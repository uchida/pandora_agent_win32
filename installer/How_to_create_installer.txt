# How to build Pandora Installer #

1) Install installjammer from http://installjammer.com/, then create the
c:\pandora_installer folder.

2) Copy the $SVN\pandora_agents\win32\bin directory to that folder and also copy the files from the installer directory ($SVN\pandora_agents\win32\installer\) to that folder.

Doing that, you must have the next directory structure:

C:\pandora_installer

		+--- pandora_1.3.1.mpi
		+--- bin
			  +--- LICENSE.txt
			  +--- README.txt
			  +--- logo.png
			  +--- pandora.ico
			  +--- libeay32.dll
			  +--- libcurl.dll
			  +--- PandoraAgent.exe
			  +--- pandora_agent.conf
			  +--- zlib1.dll
			  +--- help
			  |		+--- how_to_keys.html
		      |		+--- images
			  |			+--- 1.jpg
			  |			+--- 2.jpg
			  |			+--- 3.jpg
			  |			+--- 4.jpg
			  |			+--- 5.jpg
			  |			+--- 6.jpg
			  +--- util
			  |		+--- cut.exe
			  |		+--- date.exe
			  |		+--- expr.exe
			  |		+--- gawk.exe
			  |		+--- grep.exe
			  |		+--- head.exe
			  |		+--- ls.exe
			  |		+--- md5.exe
			  |		+--- puttygen.exe
			  |		+--- tail.exe
			  |		+--- tentacle_client.exe
			  |		+--- tr.exe
			  |		+--- wc.exe
			  +--- key
			  |		+--- id_dsa
			  |		+--- id_dsa.pub			  
			  |		+--- PUT_SSH_KEYS_HERE
			  +--- scripts
			  		+--- start_pandora_agent.bat
			  		+--- stop_pandora_agent.bat

3) Change any thing you want in your pandora_agent.conf file and also you can 
(you MUST) change your own keys to distribute them with your agents.

4) Execute InstallJammer program, and open the file C:\pandora_installer\pandora_1.3.1.mpi

5) Just go to Build menu and select Build Install (Ctrl + B).
