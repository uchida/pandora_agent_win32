Pandora is the free distributed auditing system.

This is the Windows agent, programmed in C++ with GNU tools and gcc.

In order to build from sources, you will need the latest Dev-Cpp IDE version,
with the MinGW tools. Download from http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html

Open PandoraAgent.dev with Dev-Cpp and construct the project. Everything should
compile fine in a default installation.

If you found any problem when building from source, please contact us by
email (estebans@artica.es) or the SourceForge project web.
